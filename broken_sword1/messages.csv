"0x30061","How many times have I warned you about premature extrapolation?","",""
"0x30062","All we know is that he is dead.","",""
"0x30063","It seemed reasonable to assume...","",""

"0x30075","Uh... yeah, I guess so - apart from the bomb blasts!","",""
"0x30078","I was lucky I wasn't killed!","",""
"0x30079","The Inspector passed over my remark with no reaction...","",""

"0x3008e","Oh, yeah! Now you come to mention it, there WAS a clown.","",""
"0x3008f","I didn't think much of it at the time. After all, this is Paris...","",""

"0x30091","Let us hope that your sheath does not turn out to be your shroud.","",""
"0x30092","I told you - I didn't see a thing.","",""
"0x30093","So! Be warned that I, Augustin Rosso, never rest until I reach the truth.","",""
"0x30094","You are my winkle, m'sieur, and I'm not afraid to use the pin.","",""

"0x3009f","Very well.","",""
"0x300a0","She doesn't remember seeing a clown, m'sieur.","",""
"0x300a1","That's odd, don't you think, m'sieur?","",""

"0x300a7","Enjoy your vacation, Doctor Stobbart...","",""
"0x300a8","What about my personal safety? Can't you at least give me some advice?","",""
"0x300a9","What can I say? Stay alert, and look out for suspicious characters...","",""
