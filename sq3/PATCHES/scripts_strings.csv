buck זה סלאנג, לא משהו ישן (עד כמה שאני יודע). אולי עדיף 'שקלואידים'?
לגבי ג'וקואידים - אהבתי. אבל אני זקן ;-)  לא בטוח שה""נוער של ימינו"" מכיר את הכינוי ג'וק לשקל.
לגבי ג'וקונים - נראה לי שעדיף לשמור על הסיומת ""אידים"" - גם דומה לאנגלית, וגם מזכירה אנדרואידים וכו'
ארי: מסכים לגבי הסיומת. לגבי זוז לעומת buck, למרות שהמילה buck היא סלנג, להבנתי מקורה בכך שבעבר - באמריקה של המאה ה-18 -  השתמשו ב-buck skin בתור שווה ערך כסף, ומאז זה נשאר. זוז זה אכן מיושן, אבל זה משהו שכנראה תמיד יכירו במידה כזו או אחרת (תרי-זוזי מההגדה של פסח). מצד שני, ג'וק זה מונח של שנות ה-80, והמשחק הוא כולו מחווה לאייטיז. :)
צביקה: עכשו כשאני רואה ג'וקואידים כתוב, נראה לי שזוזואידים מצלצל יותר טוב...   נשמח לעוד דעות
